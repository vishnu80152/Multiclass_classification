->  "classifer.ipynb" is the part where data cleaning and feature selection is done

->  "Classifer_model.py" is the module which consist of the working and algorthim of the model.

->  "Implemento.ipynb" is how we gona use the saved model for the classification.

->  "DATASET" it is the folder where you to give the trainig image of the class.

->  NOTE: The class which you are declaring inside the program class name if DATASET folder should be the same.

->  ODER of running this program:
    =>Classifier.ipynb
    =>classifer_model.py
    =>implementor.ipynb
